    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Falafel (pronounced "fell-off-uhl"), sometimes spelled "felafel" or "felafil," is a deep-fried ball or patty that is made from either chickpeas or fava beans and spices. It is a vegetarian and vegan food and one of the most widely consumed and recognized foods of the Middle East. It's a very popular fast food around the world, and vendors sell it on the street corners in countries like Egypt, Syria, and Israel, where it's the national dish.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup dried chickpeas</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>

        <li>4 tablespoons flour</li>
        <li>Oil, for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Place dried chickpeas in a bowl and cover with cold water. Allow to soak overnight.</li>
        <li>Drain the chickpeas and place them in a pot with fresh water. Bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Allow to boil for 5 minutes, then reduce the heat and let simmer on low for about 1 hour. Being careful not to overcook them. They should still be firm.</li>
        <li>Drain and allow to cool in the strainer for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 2 inches of oil to a heavy-bottomed large pot and heat to 350 F.</li>
        <li>Combine the drained chickpeas, onion, garlic, parsley, cumin, coriander, salt, and pepper (if using) in a medium bowl. Add the flour.</li>
        <li>Mash the chickpeas, mixing all of the ingredients together. Alternatively, you can combine the ingredients in a food processor. You want the result to be a thick paste.</li>
        <li>Form the mixture into balls about the size of a ping pong ball. Slightly flatten.</li>
        <li>Fry the falafel balls for 5 to 7 minutes until golden brown. Drain. Serve hot.</li>
