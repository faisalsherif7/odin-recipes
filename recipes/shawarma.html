    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Shawarma is thinly sliced cuts of meat, like chicken, beef, goat, lamb, and sometimes turkey rolled into a large piece of flatbread or pita that has been steamed or heated. Shawarma often is served with fries, salads like tabouleh, falafel, and just by itself for a quick bite on the go. In some places, it is served alone, without pita or flatbread.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup malt vinegar</li>
        <li>¼ cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mixed spice</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground cardamom</li>
        <li>8 skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>½ cup tahini</li>
        <li>¼ cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 medium tomatoes, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>½ cup sliced onion</li>
        <li>4 cups shredded lettuce</li>
        <li>8 pita bread rounds</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a glass baking dish, mix together the malt vinegar, 1/4 cup yogurt, vegetable oil, mixed spice, cardamom, salt and pepper. Place the chicken thighs into the mixture and turn to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small bowl, mix together the tahini, 1/4 cup yogurt, garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, and parsley. Season with salt and pepper, taste, and adjust flavors if desired. Cover and refrigerate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover the chicken and bake in the marinade for 30 minutes, turning once. Uncover, and cook for an additional 5 to 10 minutes, or until chicken is browned and cooked through. Remove from the dish, and cut into slices.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place sliced chicken, tomato, onion, and lettuce onto pita breads. Roll up, and top with the tahini sauce.
        </li>
    </ol>
