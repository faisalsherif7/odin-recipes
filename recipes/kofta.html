    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Nearly every world cuisine features some kind of meatball dish and kofta is the Middle Eastern version. At its most basic, its a mixture of very finely ground beef, onions, herbs, and spices. The meat is formed into balls or, more commonly, cigar shapes, and either baked or grilled.</p>
    <p>The term kofta and variations of the recipe can be found throughout the Middle East as well as parts of Europe and India. The Middle Eastern versions are most often made with lamb, beef or even chicken. In the Mediterranean, pork might be used and vegetarian options are found in India.</p>
